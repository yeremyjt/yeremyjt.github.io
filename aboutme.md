subtitle: Who is Yeremy Turcios?
---

I came to America in 2009, graduated from Brigham Young University (Go Cougs!... jk, I dont' care about football)
and I married the most wonderful woman on the planet. I am a father to a cute, playful boy who makes me very happy
(and doesn't let me watch movies peacefully), I am a software engineer, and I am a musician. I love programming,
playing the piano, recording music, biking, running, swimming, hiking, and reading. I'm passionate about learning,
particularly computer science topics, history, astronomy, and all things science. I like to think I'm a friendly guy,
but I am usually not friends with people who think they are better than others. Thanks for checking out this site!
