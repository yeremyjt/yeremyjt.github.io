I love playing the piano, I'm quite good at it, not a Mozart, but I can defend myself. In fact, I won a piano contest
when I was 17 by playing the Chopin's Polonaise Opus 53. I still work on classical pieces, but I also record my own
arrangements of popular songs and movie soundtracks once in a while. I use both EastWest and Native Instruments libraries,
and I record them through GarageBand, pretty basic stuff, but they sound pretty good. I guess you'll be the judge of that.

You can find my music at:

- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/yeremyjt)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/user/lajtul)

I plan to write my original songs and post them. Stay tuned.
