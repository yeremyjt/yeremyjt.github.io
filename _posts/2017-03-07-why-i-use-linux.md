I have been using Linux as my main driver for work and personal life for over a year why? Because it's *awesome!!*.
I have chose Ubuntu Linux because of the extensive documentation about it. If you a problem with it,
you bet there's another person in the world who has had the same problem and has written a solution somewhere.
I also happen to love Unity.

Linux is fast, really fast. I run on a Macbook Pro 2015, which is supposed to be a fast machine, but my OSX is just way
too slow. I also **love** the Linux terminal. It opens instantaneously and it's extremely powerful. It puts
Windows' command line program to shame.

I was hesitant to make the switch at first because I thought I wouldn't be able to be productive at work, because
we still rely heavily on Microsoft, especially on communication applications like Outlook and Skype. It turns out
that I have been able to do my work without interruptions, and actually, faster, since I switch to Linux. I'm lucky
that I code in Java, if I were a .NET developer I probably wouldn't have been able to ditch Windows.

There's only one use case that makes me use OSX, and that is recording music. I use EastWest and
Native Instruments libraries to record music, as well as GarageBand, and none of that software works on Linux.
Other than that, I don't ever touch my OSX.

Yes, sometimes I wish there were native apps for Linux, like Evernote, OneNote, and.... that's it. Everything else I need
in order to be productive is on Linux. Evernote has an amazing web app, so I don't really need their native app, although
it would be nice to play audio and video. I ditched OneNote because their web app is really, really bad. However, my grievances
with Linux are very, very minimal. I have found myself a lot more satisfied than frustrated with Linux. I honestly will
never go back to OSX, and much less Windows. I feel constrained, slow, and even a prisoner when I use those operating systems.
Your OS matters, and it matters most when it's Linux.
